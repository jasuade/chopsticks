# Implementations

Here in the ui there are tests for both implementations, however you have to import in ui.go the correct implementation
depending on the one you want to test

import (game "github.hc.ag/jsuarez/chopsticks/game/operationsImplementation")

or

import(	game "github.hc.ag/jsuarez/chopsticks/game/stateMachineImplementation")
